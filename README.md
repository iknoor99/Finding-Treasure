# Finding-Treasure
The task involves finding treasure through the given map.

The map could look like this:-

---#--###----

-#---#----##-

####-#-#-#-##

---#---#-#---

-#-####---##-

-#------#----

-############

------------@

Here, the â€“ characters indicate that you are free to move in this direction. The # character indicates
that you cannot move any further in this direction and you should go somewhere else. The @
character indicates the location of the treasure.

In your application, you will always begin searching in the top left corner of the map. So when you
run your code, you might print something like the following to the screen:
This is my challenge:

---#--###--#-

-#---#----##-

####-#-#-#-##

---#---#-#---

The + characters indicate the path that led to the treasure. The ! characters
indicate the tunnels that were tried but did not to lead to a viable path.
